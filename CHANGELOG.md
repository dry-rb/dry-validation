[Compare v1.0.0...v1.0.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-validation/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.0)

## 1.0.0 2019-06-10


### Added

- Support for parameterized macros via `rule(:foo).validate(my_macro: :some_option)` (solnic)
- `values#[]` is now compatible with path specs (symbol, array with keys or dot-notation) (issue #528) (solnic)
- `value` shortcut for accessing the value found under the first key specified by a rule. ie `rule(:foo) { value }` returns `values[:foo]` (solnic)

### Fixed

[Compare v1.0.0.rc3...v1.0.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-validation/compare/v1.0.0.rc3...v1.0.0)

## 1.0.0.rc3 2019-05-06


### Added

- [EXPERIMENTAL] `Validation.register_macro` for registering global macros (solnic)
- [EXPERIMENTAL] `Contract.register_macro` for registering macros available to specific contract classes (solnic)
- `Dry::Validation.Contract` shortcut for quickly defining a contract and getting its instance back (solnic)
- New configuration option `config.locale` for setting the default locale (solnic)

## 1.0.0.rc2 2019-05-04

This was **yanked** on rubygems.org because the bundled gem was missing `config` directory, thus it was not possible to require it. It was fixed in `rc3`.

### Added

- [EXPERIMENTAL] support for registering macros via `Dry::Validation::Macros.register(:your_macro, &block)` (solnic)
- [EXPERIMENTAL] `:acceptance` as the first built-in macro (issue #157) (solnic)

- Dependency on `dry-initializer` was bumped to `~> 3.0` (solnic)

[Compare v1.0.0.beta2...v1.0.0.rc1](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-validation/compare/v1.0.0.beta2...v1.0.0.rc1)

## 1.0.0.beta2 2019-04-04


### Added

- Support for arbitrary meta-data in failures, ie:

  ```ruby
  class NewUserContract < Dry::Validation::Contract
    params do
      required(:login).filled(:string)
    end

    rule(:login) do
      key.failure(text: 'is taken', code: 123) unless db.unique?(values[:login])

  end
  ```

  Now your error hash will include `{ login: [{ text: 'is taken', code: 123 }] }` (solnic + flash-gordon)

### Changed

- Result objects use `ErrorSet` object now for managing messages (solnic)

### Changed

- [BREAKING] `Result#errors` returns an instance of `ErrorSet` now, it's an enumerable, coerible to a hash (solnic)
- [BREAKING] `failure` was removed in favor of `key.failure` or `key(:foo).failure` (solnic)
- [BREAKING] `Result#to_hash` was removed (flash-gordon)
