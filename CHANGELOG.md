### Added

* Support for macros:
  * `required` - when value must be filled

  * `when` - for composing high-level rule based on predicates applied to a
    validated value
  * `confirmation` - for confirmation validation
* Support for `value(:foo).eql?(value(:bar))` syntax in high-level rules (solnic)

* `Result#messages` supports `:full` option to get messages with rule names, disabled by default (solnic)
* `Validation::Result` responds to `#[]` and `#each` (delegating to its output)
  and it's an enumerable (solnic)

### Changed

* `schema` was **removed** from the DSL, just use `key(:name).schema` instead (solnic)
* `confirmation` is now a macro that you can call on a key rule (solnic)
* rule names for nested structures are now fully qualified, which means you can
  provide customized messages for them. ie `user: :email` (solnic)
* `Schema::Result#params` was renamed to `#output` (solnic)
* `Schema::Result` is now `Validation::Result` and it no longer has success and
  failure results, only error results are provided (solnic)

### Fixed

* Qualified rule names properly use last node by default for error messages (solnic)
* Validation hints only include relevant messages (solnic)
* `:yaml` messages respect `:locale` option in `Result#messages` (solnic)

  predicate names and built-in `Object` methods (solnic)
* In `Schema::Form` both `key` and `optional` will apply `filled?` predicate by
  default when no block is passed (solnic)
