- version: 1.10.0
  summary: This release is mostly about upgrading to dry-core 1.0 and dry-configurable 1.0. One of the outcomes is dropping dependency on dry-container (because it was moved to dry-core). If you happen to use dry-container, please switch to `Dry::Core::Container`.

  summary: See [the list of all addressed issues](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-validation/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A%3E%3D2019-01-01+)
    as well as issues that were moved to dry-schema and [addressed there](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-schema/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+dry-validation+milestone%3A1.0.0).
- version: 1.0.0
  date: '2019-06-10'
  added:
  - Support for defining rules for each element of an array via `rule(:items).each
    { ... }` (solnic)
  - 'Support for parameterized macros via `rule(:foo).validate(my_macro: :some_option)`
    (solnic)'
  - "`values#[]` is now compatible with path specs (symbol, array with keys or dot-notation)
    (issue #528) (solnic)"
  - "`value` shortcut for accessing the value found under the first key specified
    by a rule. ie `rule(:foo) { value }` returns `values[:foo]` (solnic)"
  fixed:
  - Contract's `config.locale` option was replaced by `config.messages.default_locale`
    to avoid conflicts with run-time `:locale` option and/or whatever is set via `I18n`
    gem (solnic)
  - Macros no longer mutate `Dry::Validation::Contract.macros` when using inheritance
    (solnic)
  - Missing dependency on `dry-container` was added (solnic)
  changed:
  - "`rule` will raise `InvalidKeysError` when specified keys are not defined by the
    schema (solnic)"
  - "`Contract.new` will raise `SchemaMissingError` when the class doesn't have schema
    defined (solnic)"
  - 'Contracts no longer support `:locale` option in the constructor. Use `Result#errors(locale:
    :pl)` to change locale at run-time (solnic)'
- version: 1.0.0.rc3
  date: '2019-05-06'
  added:
  - "[EXPERIMENTAL] `Validation.register_macro` for registering global macros (solnic)"
  - "[EXPERIMENTAL] `Contract.register_macro` for registering macros available to
    specific contract classes (solnic)"

    its instance back (solnic)"

    of this** (solnic)"
- version: 1.0.0.rc2
  date: '2019-05-04'
  summary: This was **yanked** on rubygems.org because the bundled gem was missing
    `config` directory, thus it was not possible to require it. It was fixed in `rc3`.
  added:
  - "[EXPERIMENTAL] support for registering macros via `Dry::Validation::Macros.register(:your_macro,
    &block)` (solnic)"
  - "[EXPERIMENTAL] `:acceptance` as the first built-in macro (issue #157) (solnic)"

  - Passing invalid argument to `failure` will raise a meaningful error instead of
    crashing (solnic)
  changed:
  - In rule validation blocks, `values` is now an instance of a hash-like `Dry::Validation::Values`
    class, rather than `Dry::Schema::Result`. This gives more convenient access to
    data within rules (solnic)
  - Dependency on `dry-schema` was updated to `~> 1.0` (solnic)
- version: 1.0.0.rc1
  date: '2019-04-26'

  - "`Contract#inspect` no longer crashes (solnic)"
  changed:
  - Dependency on `dry-schema` was bumped to `~> 0.6` - this pulls in `dry-types 1.0.0`
    and `dry-logic 1.0.0` (solnic)
  - Dependency on `dry-initializer` was bumped to `~> 3.0` (solnic)
- version: 1.0.0.beta2
  date: '2019-04-04'
  added:
  - |-
    Support for arbitrary meta-data in failures, ie:

      ```ruby
      class NewUserContract < Dry::Validation::Contract
        params do
          required(:login).filled(:string)
        end

        rule(:login) do
          key.failure(text: 'is taken', code: 123) unless db.unique?(values[:login])
        end
      end
      ```

    (solnic)"
